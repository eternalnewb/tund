Property list files describing daemons are installed in /Library/LaunchDaemons, and those describing agents are installed in /Library/LaunchAgents or in the LaunchAgents subdirectory of an individual userâ€™s Library directory. (The appropriate location for executables that you launch from your job is /usr/local/libexec.)
